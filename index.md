I am a senior lecturer in the <a href="/medicine/dide">Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology</a> within the <a href="http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/publichealth/">School of Public Health</a> at Imperial College London. I am also a principal investigator of the <a href="http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/medicine/about/institutes/outbreaks/">MRC Centre for Outbreak Analysis and Modelling</a> and of the <a href="http://www1.imperial.ac.uk/hprumodelling/">NIHR Health Protection Research Unit in Modelling Methodology</a>.

### Research interests

My research is focused on the analysis of genomic data in order to improve our understanding of bacterial evolution, epidemiology, ecology and pathogenicity. A key aim is to develop new bioinformatics and statistical methods that can handle the very large amounts of data made available by novel high-throughput sequencing techniques. 

Because of the interdisciplinary nature of my work, I have broad interests in a variety of subjects, including theoretical topics such as mathematical population genetics, Bayesian statistics or Monte-Carlo methods, and biological topics such as bacterial evolutionary processes or pathogen epidemiology.

I have worked on a wide range of bacterial pathogens, especially those causing healthcare associated infections (eg <em>Clostridium difficile</em> and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>) and gastrointestinal infections (eg <em>Salmonella enterica</em>, <em>Bacillus cereus</em>, <em>Campylobacter jejuni</em> and <em>Helicobacter pylori</em>).
