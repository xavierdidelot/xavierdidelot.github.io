## Welcome!

My name is Xavier Didelot and I am a university lecturer at Imperial College London.
My research interests are in statistical population genomics of bacteria, see below for more details and links to some
freely available software.

### Research interests

My research is focused on the analysis of genomic data in order to improve our understanding of bacterial evolution, epidemiology, ecology and pathogenicity. A key aim is to develop new bioinformatics and statistical methods that can handle the very large amounts of data made available by novel high-throughput sequencing techniques.

Because of the interdisciplinary nature of my work, I have broad interests in a variety of subjects, including theoretical topics such as mathematical population genetics, Bayesian statistics or Monte-Carlo methods, and biological topics such as bacterial evolutionary processes or pathogen epidemiology.

I have worked on a wide range of bacterial pathogens, especially those causing healthcare associated infections (eg Clostridium difficile and Staphylococcus aureus) and gastrointestinal infections (eg Salmonella enterica, Bacillus cereus, Campylobacter jejuni and Helicobacter pylori).

### Collaborations

I collaborate with the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.modmedmicro.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Modernising Medical Microbiology consortium</a>&nbsp;which brings together the University of Oxford, Public Health England, the Sanger Institute and the NHS, with the aim of revolutionising our understanding of human pathogens through the use of whole-genome sequencing technology. Three major bacterial pathogens are under particular investigation: <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, <em>Clostridium difficile</em> and <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>.
