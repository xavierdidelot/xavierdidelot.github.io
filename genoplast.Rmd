## Introduction

Acquisition and loss of genetic material are essential forces in bacterial microevolution. They have been repeatedly linked with adaptation of lineages to new lifestyles, and in particular pathogenicity. GenoPlast implements a model-based method for using whole genome sequences to infer the patterns of genome content evolution. The method is described in <a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2008/11/17/gr.082263.108.abstract">Didelot, Darling and Falush (2009)</a>. A fundamental property of our model is that it allows the rates at which genetic elements are gained or lost to vary in time and from one lineage to another.
